# C-C++ Practice Repository

Welcome to the **C-C++ Practice Repository**! This repository is designed to store my practice code and examples as I learn C and C++ through various books and video resources. Each practice example is organized into folders based on the resource used.


### **Resource Organization**
- **resources/**: This folder contains subfolders for each book or video resource.
